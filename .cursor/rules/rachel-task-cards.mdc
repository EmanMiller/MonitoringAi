# Rachel – Task Cards Location

When creating new task card or task breakdown `.md` files:

- **Always place them in:** `MonitoringAi/task-cards/`
- **Examples:** `TASK_CARDS_*.md`, `TASK_BREAKDOWN_*.md`, or any new task-related document

Do not create task card files in the project root. Use `task-cards/` as the single location for all team task documentation.

## Post-task workflow (always follow)

After any task is completed, execute in order:

1. **@MonitoringAi/.cursor/rules/becca-qa-walkthrough.mdc** — Run QA walkthrough and sign off
2. **@MonitoringAi/.cursor/rules/paul-security.mdc** — Run security walkthrough and sign off
3. **Update @MonitoringAi/.cursor/rules/dan-coordination.mdc** — Add completed task to Completed tasks section
4. **@MonitoringAi/.cursor/rules/dan-git-version-control.mdc** — Commit, push to production
