# Rachel – Task Cards Location

When creating new task card or task breakdown `.md` files:

- **Always place them in:** `MonitoringAi/task-cards/`
- **Examples:** `TASK_CARDS_*.md`, `TASK_BREAKDOWN_*.md`, or any new task-related document

Do not create task card files in the project root. Use `task-cards/` as the single location for all team task documentation.
